# FIX-It Physio Website

[View the live project here.](https://pp4-fix-it-physio.herokuapp.com/)

This website was created as an appoinment database for a new physio who is setting up his own practice.  The physio does not have the finance to hire a secretary so it is a system for his patients to be able to book a date and time that would suit them to come and visit.

## Site Goals:

The goals for this site are as follows:
* Allow users to make a appointment for the physio
* Allow users to edit or cancel their appointment
* Allow the physio to access the list of appointments in the database to ensure that all appointments have been confirmed.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

To demonstrate the Agile approach that was used for this project, GitHub issues were created and a Kanban board was used to record all the user stories. The user stories were categorised using different labels, i.e Must have, Should Have and Could have. Each story was then moved from 'To Do' to 'In Progress' to 'Done' as the project progressed, with Could have stories moved to a future version category.

All code was created and manipulated by myself after searching answers in google. Websites I used more than once were - Geeks for Geeks, W3Schools and Stack Overflow, as well as Code Institute Course PP4 content.

I had no mentor for this project. I would like to thank my family who tested the website for me.
